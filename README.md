## <h2>Async</h2>
    automatically transforms a regular function into a Promise.
    When called async functions resolve with whatever is returned in their body.
    Async functions enable the use of await.
## <h2>Await</h2>
    when placed in front of a Promise call, await forces the rest of the code to wait until that Promise finishes and returns a result.
    Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks. Await can only be used inside async functions.
## <h2>Promise</h2>
    promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value
    To send all requests at the same time a Promise.all() is required
    _states:_
        pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
        rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

## <h2>Middleware</h2>
    is software that bridges gaps between other applications
    The app responds for requests to the root URL (/) or route when used. 
    For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found.
    Modules are a way to split an application into separate files
    instead of having all of your application in one file. 

## <h2>MongoDB</h2> 
    with Mongoose (for modeling) provide a backend for your Node.js application

## <h2>Redis</h2>
    is a key/value store -- commonly used for sessions and caching in Node.js applications.
    an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, 
    cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, 
    sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.

## <h2>Schema</h2>
    is an outline, diagram, or model often used to describe the structure of different types of data
